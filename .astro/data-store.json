She was the first bird, christened Archaeopteryx by archeologists.\n\n![fossil of Archaeopteryx embedded in rock](https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/VVcr5oUTcXlYNuzVjCHdUD6uxlM=/1500x1000/filters:fill(auto,1)/2048px-Archaeopteryx_fossil-5c5b17f246e0fb0001849b0e.jpg)*The fossilized remains of an Archaeopteryx caught doing the worm.*\n\nUnfortunately for Miss A. and her ilk, the skies were fiercely competitive environments.  By the time Archaeopteryx burst into existence, their (mostly) featherless cousins, pterosaurs, had already been around for fifty million years, giving them plenty of time to grow to gargantuan proportions, with carnivorous appetites to match.\n\nIf you stole a time machine and was face-to-face with a large pterosaur, you would be eaten, so instead here's an sculptor's rendition of the largest species of pterosaur known to us (based on fossils):\n\n![model of the quetzalcoatlus pterosaur next to an 160 centimeter tall man](https://i.redd.it/mjn2gamsosg01.jpg)*Model of quetzalcoatlus northropi next to a guy of average height*\n\nThe quetzalcoatlus has a stupid beak-to-body ratio, and would be hard to keep in a zoo, mainly because it would keep eating all the exotic animals.\nIt was essentially a winged, carnivorous giraffe with a giant sword for a head.  \n\nWith the discovery of more and more of these types of fossils, evidence increasingly points to the large beak-spears having a dual function as a tool for bored pterosaurs, who could have frequently used them in mock-swordfights with their siblings.\n\n![Illustration of two pterodactyls sword-fighting]()*The art of swordsmanship is said to have surfaced in the late Triassic Period*\n\n\n\nYour average pigeon may dream of glory from days past, when the median temperature was a muggy four celsius above modern times and the pterosaur reigned supreme, but it is mistaken, for its true ancestor was Archaeopteryx, who looked rather timid in comparison.\n\nBut in a serendipitous turn of events, something rather big happened 66 million years ago in the northwest margin of the Yucatán Peninsula that wiped out quetzalcoatlus and almost all large species on Earth, robbing them of the opportunity to evolve into even more formidable and giving Archaeopteryx an immeasurable advantage.\n\n### Conjecture?\nUnfortunately, dried old bones can't tell us everything.  There's a fair amount of guesswork at play here, so we can't be certain what pterosaurs and Archaeopteryx looked like unless we invent a time machine.\nPterosaurs may have been a startling shade of hot pink for all we know.\n\n## On the Origin of Bords\n\nAbout 73,000 days ago, a twenty-something university graduate preparing for a mundane career as a clergyman recieved an invite from the ship's captain to join the 10-gun warship-turned survey ship the SMH Beagle (supposedly the ship's captain was in need of a geologist).\n\nTen points if you can guess who the university graduate was (If you can't for some reason, it was Charles Darwin).\n\nDuring the voyage, while the ship and crew carried out coastline surveys Darwin did as he pleased, thinking up what was to become the book everyone recognizes him for. \n\n[](sdr)\n\nA lesser-known fact about Darwin is that during this time, he discovered a\nlesser-known species dubbed \"the sea-llama of Peru\"\n\n![An actual sea llama](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/583b4d62d2b857c44d4d4c90/1587242632144-CVEGUNDO9W3XFHMEZ5IP/Nembrotha+cristata+-+alpaca+of+the+sea.jpg) *A sea-llama in the flesh**\n\nAfter surveying the coasts of South America, the SMH Beagle stopped by the Galapagos Islands.

As you flip through each one (at incredible speeds), it resembles a gradient of creatures, morphing from one form to the next.\n\nWe can do the same with the finches.

It's just a computer that's been shrunk down to 20 centimeters, with a few odds and ends removed to get everything to fit.\n\nThe most important thing that's missing is a tangible interface. Without peripherals plugged into it, it's a black box of mystery and heat.\n\n[](sdr)\n\nThis makes mini PCs inefficient for use as a laptop, but but more suited to use as an unobtrusive home server or desktop computer.\n\n![GIF of a shrimp using a computer by @tinysoulgame on Twitter](/images/posture.gif)_The right way to use a mini PC_\n\nA mini PC is a good choice for a home server because of its small size, and general noiselessness. You can stash it away in a corner with a power source and it'll run fine.\n\n[](sdl)\n\nDue to their diminuitive size, some models may whirr at annoying volumes.

The area around your router may be a desert of creature comforts, so it may help to perform cool hacker thingz while reposing on an armchair with deep cushions.\n\nFor anyone still following along, this means you can put the monitor and keyboard back and go sit in a more comfortable location.\n\n### Running The Block Game\n\nAt last, the content you clicked on this blog post for!\nTo do this, you'll need a few things as listed below:\n\n#### What You'll Need\n\n1. **Docker**\n   For running and deploying the server. Not strictly required but provides containerization and ease of management\n\n1. **Admin access to your home router**\n   For port forwarding your local IP address\n\n1. **A Domain Name**\n   To function as your server's IP address\n\n1. **Basic command line proficiency**\n   All readers will be assumed to know her/his way around the bash shell\n\nThe first step is to find a suitable folder to house your server. I put mine in my home directory.\n\nQuickly `mkdir` a folder to be your data directory and create a `docker-compose.yml` file inside.\nThis is your soon-to-exist docker container's config file.\n\nInside that file is a list of options to choose when creating and running your docker container, such as the image you're using, what ports you want and the location to your data volume.\n\n_An example docker-compose file for running a minecraft server:_\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"3\"\nservices:\n  minecraft:\n    image: itzg/minecraft-server:java8 # the docker image for this container\n    container_name: mc\n    restart: on-failure\n    user: root # Runs the container as root, use this if you have permission errors\n    ports:\n      - 25585:25565 # Customizing the port to be 25585 instead of 25565 (by default it is 25565:25565) \n    environment:\n      EULA: \"TRUE\"\n      TZ: \"Antarctica/Davis\"\n      ENABLE_AUTOPAUSE: \"TRUE\"\n      AUTOPAUSE_TIMEOUT_EST: \"900\"\n      TYPE: \"FORGE\" # The server type (not necessary for vanilla)\n      VERSION: \"1.16.5\" # Minecraft version\n\t    FORGEVERSION: \"36.1.3\" # Forge build version\n      INIT_MEMORY: 20G\n      MAX_MEMORY: 20G\n      JVM_XX_OPTS: \"-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200\" # JVM arguments\n      OPS: \"OrangeBurrito_\" # list of OP'ed players, separated by spaces\n    volumes:\n      - /home/orangeburrito/Documents/mc_server:/data\n\t\t# Where the your data directory is located and where minecraft files go (absolute path)\n\t\t# replace [/home/orangeburrito/mc_server] with your path\n```\n\nOnce you've finished tailoring your docker-compose file, run `docker-compose up -d` and wait.\n\n> the `-d` flag in the command refers to Detached Mode, meaning that the container will run in the background.\n\nTo see what's happening, run `docker logs [name of your container]`.\nYou can optionally add a `--since` flag to only view the logs generated in a given time period.\n\nIt takes around a minute for a vanilla server to start up.  For a heavily modded forge server it may take around 5-10 minutes.\n\nYou'll see logs like this once the server has started:\n\n```shell\n[13:55:37] [server thread/INFO] [minecraft/LoggingChunkStatusListener]: Preparing spawn area: 98%\n[13:55:38] [server thread/INFO] [minecraft/LoggingChunkStatusListener]: Preparing spawn area: 99%\n[13:55:38] [server thread/INFO] [minecraft/LoggingChunkStatusListener]: Time elapsed: 53343 ms\n[13:55:38] [server thread/INFO] [minecraft/Dedicatedserver]: Done (55.363s)! For help, type \"help\"\n[13:55:38] [server thread/INFO] [minecraft/Dedicatedserver]: Starting remote control listener\n[13:55:38] [server thread/INFO] [minecraft/RConThread]: Thread RCON Listener started\n[13:55:38] [server thread/INFO] [minecraft/MainThread]: RCON running on 0.0.0.0:25575\n```\n\nTo join the server, open Minecraft and type in your Mini PC's IP address and your server's port (as specified in the compose file) and press Connect to server.\n\n*An example server IP address:* `192.168.1.179:25585`\n`192...179` is my Mini PC's local IP address, and `25585` is the server's port.\n\n![Newly created Minecraft server in Multiplayer Section in-game](/images/server_running.png)*how your Minecraft server will appear in the Multiplayer Tab in-game*\n\nHallelujah! You've now got your very own Minecraft server up and running.  Now what about customizing it?\n\n## Pimp My Pixels\n\nSay you want to use your custom Minecraft map on your server, or add a few mods to the mix.\n\nLooking at the data folder, there's a few important files to take note of, firstly the `server.properties` file.\n\nThis is your server's config file and contains options like enabling whitelisting and changing the Message Of The Day ( the text that appears below the server name).\n\n![Screenshot of a list of files in the data directory](/images/inside_data_folder.png)*Inside your server's data directory*\n\nIf you want to change your server world, you can either swap out the existing world folder for your custom world, or change the `level-name` property in `server.properties` to match your custom world folder.\n\nIf you're running a Forge/Fabric server, there will be a `mods` and `config` folder that contain, you guessed it, mods and mod config files!\n\nFor more information, the [Docker Minecraft Server's Github](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) has useful documentation about fine-tuning your server.\n\n## Pushing Ports\n\nRight now your server is only running on your local network, meaning your friends off and away in Great Places won't be able to join it.\n\nYou'll need to perform the vaunted mystical and mysterious spell known as **Port Forwarding** to yank your little old server out of its podunk little LAN network and into the big, bustling metropolis known as the World Wide Web.\n\nTo dispell the thick aura of mystery surrounding this term, here's a quick explanation:\n\nPort Forwarding allows computers connected to the 'net to connect to a computer in a local network (A.K.A a computer behind a router).\n\nThis is where \"admin access to your home router\" comes into play.  Every router's user interface is different, but in general they follow the same routine.\n\nType in your router's IP address into your browser and log into the router's webpage.\n> You can find login info on the back of the router\n\n![Screenshot of port forwarding system settings in Synology Router](/images/synology_port_forwarding.png)\n\nNavigate over to the **Port Forwarding** section of your router and create a new Port Forwarding Rule.\n\nBoth the public and private ports should be `25565`, or whatever ports you specified in your `docker-compose` file.\nThe protocol should be `TCP/UDP`.\n\n### Domain Time\n\nIf you use Namecheap as your domain name registrar, there's already a barebones guide on how to connect your Minecraft Server to your domain, at [this link](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9765/2208/how-can-i-link-my-domain-name-to-a-minecraft-server/).\n\n> You can find your router's IP Address by googling \"What's my IP Address\".\n\n**An Optional Step**: if you haven't paid for a static IP Address, you can enable DDNS instead.\n\nYour home network and its devices will be assigned new IP addresses every 24 hours by your ISP. This is an issue when you want to map a domain name to a constantly changing IP address, thus forcing you to manually update it on the daily.\nIf you're like me and are surprised at the exorbitant prices for static IP addresses (it's exactly what it says on the tin), you can use the Dynamic Domain Name System and have the program automatically update the address mapped to your domain name.\n\n![A picture of a  shell running DDCLient](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iuDCuUEmKF4/maxresdefault.jpg)*Insert pic to break up all this text, semi-related?*\n\nOn my NUC, I installed ddclient as a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/ddclient) and created a docker-compose file, which I promptly ran to generate the ddclient config file.\n\nInside the file I used my text editor of choice (I'm leaning towards vim nowadays) to insert my server URL, domain password and optional subdomain.\n\nAfter a quick re-run of the compose file and checking of the logs, it was up and running.\n\n```shell\nSUCCESS:  updating mc: good: IP address set to [Port Forwarded IP Address]\n```\n\nThis is what your logs should look like ⬏\n\n\nNow the last thing to do is type your domain into your Minecraft client and join.  From there, you can share the server's IP Address to all your friends and peoples of the web.  🎉 yee","src/pages/posts/minecraft_mini_pc.md","e4c083f501e24a0f",{"html":180,"metadata":181},"\u003C!-- ## Table of Contents\n- etymology of \"nuc\"\n- why did I get this thing and should you\n- how to set it up\n\t- what you need, options, installing npm, ssh permission\n- installing docker\n- setting up server\n- copying files, running it, logs -->\n\u003Cp>This is a brief guide detailing the setup of an Intel NUC, and a tutorial on how to run a Minecraft server on it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this blogpost we’ll be sparring in a headless Linux environment, so keep that in mind.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>You can also use a cloud service provider to host your Minecraft server, which comes with its own pros and cons.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"i-cant-believe-its-not-pc\">I Can’t Believe It’s Not PC!®\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>First of all, what is a mini PC?

Install the `qt5` and `pkg-config` packages from [Homebrew](https:/brew.sh/), and the XCode Command Line tools if you haven't already.\n```sh\nxcode-select --install\nbrew install qt5\nbrew install pkg-config\n```\n\nOnce finished, unzip your Nethack download, and navigate to the folder via your terminal. `cd ~/wherever/youputthefolder/NetHack-NetHack-3.6.7_Released/`\n\nMore comprehensive information on building is available on the [wiki](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Compiling).\n\nInside the root of said directory, run `setup.sh` with the appropriate hint, `macos-qt` as it uses qt5 instead qt4 (which is deprecated).\n\nThis configures the Makefile with the requisite information for building.\n```sh\nsys/unix/setup.sh sys/unix/hints/macosx10.10-qt\n```\n\nIt should run without issue.\n\nAfter, you'll need to edit the `include/tradstdc.h` file to fix a compilation error that apparently hasn't been fixed in the official release yet.\n```sh\n# still inside Nethack/, use nano if you're unfamiliar with vim\nvim include/tradstdc.h\n```\n\nStarting at line 434, add these two lines indicated below, without the surrounding comments or \"NEW LINE\"\n```c\n#if !defined(__linux__) || defined(GCC_URWARN)\n/* disable gcc's __attribute__((__warn_unused_result__)) since explicitly\n   discarding the result by casting to (void) is not accepted as a 'use' */\n/* #ifndef __clang__ NEW LINE */\n#define __warn_unused_result__ /*empty*/\n#define warn_unused_result /*empty*/\n/* #endif NEW LINE */\n#endif\n```\n\nThen save the file (`:wq!`) and run the following command before you build to configure your C installation,\nif the compiler has trouble finding it (the 'stdio.h not found' error)\n\n```sh\nexport CPATH=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include\n```\n\nAnd now build your application either in the base directory or in `/src`.\n\nYou can find your QT path by running `brew info qt5`, it'll look something like `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qt@5/5.15.12`\n\n```sh\nmake WANT_WIN_QT=1 QTDIR=[QT Path]\n```\n\nAfter it finishes building, run `make install` to create your executable. If you've built successfully, it should output a short blurb about the game version and what platform it was built for (darwin...)\n\nBy default, your nethack installation is located at your home directory, at `~/nethackdir`.\n\nFor one last step before you can run Nethack with working tiles, you'll need to configure your tileset first, as a bug in the build process doesn't properly convert the default tileset to bmp files.\n\nYou can download the default tileset for 3.6 [here](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Tileset#Default_tileset). Other tilesets are also linked below. My personal favorite is [Nevanda 32x](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Forum:Nethack_3.6.0_tileset_nevanda_32x32).\n\nAfter you've downloaded it, convert the png to a .bmp file with your program/website of choice. If you have the ImageMagick CLI installed, it's a simple matter of running `magick mytileset.png mytileset.bmp`.\n\nMove your freshly-baked bitmap directly into the `/nethackdir` folder, then edit your `.nethackrc` file.\n\nIf you don't have the config file already, create it in your home directory and open it.\n```sh\ntouch ~/.nethackrc\nvim ~/.nethackrc\n```\n\nInside, add the following line anywhere, replacing Tileset.bmp with whatever you named yours. (no relative paths)\n```sh\nOPTIONS=tile_file:Tileset.bmp\n# if you use a higher-resolution tileset, specify the width/height at the end, e.g.\nOPTIONS=tile_file:SharperTileset.bmp,tile_width:32,tile_height:32\n```\n\nFinally, run the `nethack` executable inside `nethackdir`, and enjoy. If your paths and filenames are correct you should be dungeon-crawling with gloriously colored pixels.\n\nIf the map interface is too small, you can adjust the tile width/height in `Game > Qt Settings`, increasing or decreasing the resolution in pixels by orders of magnitude.\n\n![Screenshot of a session of Nethack Qt](/images/successful.png)_A barbarian wanderers around a pixel-painted dungeon, on a freshly compiled version of Nethack Qt_\n\n## Fin\nThe Qt verion's user interface does leave a lot to be desired, lacking the simple elegance of Curses' cleanly organized windows, but that's the price you pay in search of precious pixels.\n\nTo the poor internet user reading this after having scoured the web to no avail, I hope this helped.","src/pages/posts/nethack-gui-macos.md","facf2692cf5bb5c7",{"html":233,"metadata":234},"\u003Cp>Due to a lack of useful or up-to-date information on the subject, here’s a short guide for how to compile the Qt Interface for Nethack on later versions of Mac, (Ventura and upwards, works on Apple Silicon)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sadly, the homebrew version of nethack doesn’t support tiles, hence this post.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Note:\u003C/strong> I highly recommend you have at least some level of proficiency around a terminal, otherwise an inordinate amount of pain will ensue if certain things go wrong.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"begin\">Begin\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Start by downloading \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/releases\">Nethack’s latest release build\u003C/a>, v3.6.7, as a zip file.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Before you do anything else, you’ll need to install Qt.
