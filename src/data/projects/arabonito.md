I designed and developed the frontend for Arajet's Gift Card Program Arabonito, while working as a subcontractor under Huagati Systems.

Using a custom-built component library, I reapplied their existing brand identity to their new e-commerce site (backend built by Huagati Systems), while adhering to UI/UX best practices for performance and user retention/satisfaction.  

## Design
After getting the brief and an overview of the existing unstyled app's skeleton, I started drafting out potential designs.

As Arajet had no existing style guide at the time, their website was my main visual reference when building out Arabonito's component library and basic site flow in Figma.

## Implementation
With the initial design approved by Arajet, implementation was under way.
