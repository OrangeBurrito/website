From my previous experience with building Arajet's [Arabonito](https://arabonito.arajet.com) site, I was able to apply many aspects of the previous design and development flow onto this project.

## Design
Following the initial design process of exploration with pen-and-paper sketches, I moved onto building the Figma mock-ups, along with highly interactive prototypes (on both mobile and desktop) to meet the Referrals app's more complex feature requirements.

## Development
From my previous work on Arabonito, I was able to reapply my preexisting component library for the new Referrals project, with modifications to the library, from general refactoring to the visual, according to Arajet's new style guide.
